### Runtime complexity

Referring to the algorithm you implemented in the function **monotonic** in the
file **edit_me.py** and assuming that the input list has length **N**,

* the big-O worst-case complexity is O(N), and
* the big-O best-case complexity is O(N).

Referring to the code block below,
* the big-O worst-case complexity of the function **search** is O(log N).
  ```python
  def search(lst, key):

      assert monotonic(lst), "The list is not sorted"

      low = 0
      mid = len(lst) // 2
      high = len(lst) - 1

      while (high >= low):
          mid = (high + low) // 2
          if (lst[mid] < key):
              low = mid + 1
          elif (lst[mid] > key):
              high = mid - 1
          else:
              return mid

      return -1
  ```

Notes:
* Recall that, in Python, an **assert** statement has this form:
  ```python
  assert Boolean_expression, string
  ```
* Upon execution of an **assert** statement, **Boolean_expression** is evaluated; if it
  evaluates to **False**, execution is halted and error-message **string** is displayed.
  If **Boolean_expression** evaluates to **True**, then execution of the program continues.

#### Critique

I would use the function **search** (defined above) in real life because it efficiently finds an element in a sorted list using binary search and because its time complexity is O(log N), making it much faster than a linear search (O(N)) for large datasets.

I would not use the function **search** in real life because it assumes the list is monotonic, but monotonic does not mean sorted and because it does not handle lists sorted in descending order, as binary search assumes an ascending order.
